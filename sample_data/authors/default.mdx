WeekUp is my personal weekly learning journal where I document my journey through the ever-evolving world of technology and software development. Each week, I share insights, discoveries, and practical knowledge gained from my experiences as a backend developer. The name "WeekUp" reflects both the weekly cadence of updates and the continuous upward trajectory of growth in our field.

As a backend developer with over 5 years of experience, I've had the privilege of building scalable solutions for 250+ clients worldwide, currently focusing on telemedicine infrastructure. Through WeekUp, I aim to contribute to the developer community by sharing not just technical insights, but also practical approaches to problem-solving and professional growth. When I'm not coding or writing, I channel my passion for web development into creating browser extensions that enhance developer productivity.
