summary: Vibe coding feels smooth and aesthetic, but it’s also kinda slow. Here's what to do while your AI is generating code — without losing flow or falling into distractions.

We’re in the vibe coding era now.  
Lo-fi on.  
Prompts crafted.  
Cursor blinking.

You ask your AI to write a function, a layout, maybe even a whole damn feature. And then… you wait.

This is the weird part.  
Because vibe coding is fun — but it’s also slow.  
It’s not you writing line by line anymore. It’s you watching the code appear. Waiting for it.

And in that waiting space, distraction creeps in fast.  
A tab.  
A ping.  
A scroll.  
Suddenly, you’re not building anymore.

So here’s a small list of things you _can_ do while your AI is working —  
Not to kill time.  
But to stay close to flow.

### 🍵 Do a tiny code cleanup

Rename a file.  
Drop a comment.  
Fix a weird indent.  
It keeps you in the code without stepping on the AI’s toes.

### 🚶‍♂️ Stand, stretch, drink water

Basic stuff. Still undefeated.  
Sometimes stepping away physically brings you closer mentally.

### 🌿 Look out the window

No phone. No agenda.  
Just a pause. You’d be surprised how refreshing 30 seconds of sky can be.

### ✍️ Sketch something

Could be in your notebook, could be in Figma.  
Doodle an idea. Shape a rough thought. Doesn’t have to make sense yet.

### 🔤 Draft a commit message

Even if you haven’t committed yet.  
Helps you frame what just happened.  
"feat: added whimsical card animation logic" feels kinda nice to write.

### 🎧 Queue your reward song

You know the one.  
The track that hits when things _click_.  
Line it up. You’re almost there.

### 📋 Peek at your task list

Just a glance.  
Not a deep dive into Notion hell.  
Just enough to remember why you started this branch in the first place.

Waiting is part of the process now.  
But you don’t have to be idle, or bored, or lost in another app.

Let the AI code.  
You stay in the vibe.
