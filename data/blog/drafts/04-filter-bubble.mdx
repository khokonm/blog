summary: 'A DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) order is a medical directive that lets patients choose not to receive CPR if their heart stops. It gives control over end-of-life care while still allowing other treatments. Understanding DNR helps make informed decisions about medical care when it matters most.'

Ever felt like your social media feed *just gets you*? Always showing the content you agree with, 
the news you find interesting, and the opinions you already hold? That’s not intuition—it’s **the filter bubble** at work.  

### **So, What’s a Filter Bubble?** 🫧  

The **filter bubble** is an invisible digital cage. Platforms like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube **personalize your feed** based on what you click, like, share, and watch. 
Over time, you stop seeing what doesn’t match your interests, and your world gets smaller without you even noticing.  

🔍 **Example?**  
- Google two different political topics in incognito mode vs. your logged-in account. The results will be *wildly different*.  
- Your YouTube homepage? A mirror of your past clicks, steering you further down the rabbit hole.  
- Ever wondered why your friends’ feeds look completely different from yours? That’s the filter bubble shaping perspectives.  

It’s not just about convenience. It’s about **control**. 
You’re being fed a **curated reality**, not an objective one.  

## **Why This Matters** ⚠️  

Think you’re seeing the full picture online? **Think again.**  

Every time you scroll, search, or watch, an algorithm is silently deciding what to show you—and more importantly, what **not** to show you. 
The internet was once a place of endless discovery, but now? It’s a **personalized maze**, trapping you inside your own preferences.  

### **Why should you care?**  
🔸 **Narrower worldviews** – You keep seeing the same perspectives, making it harder to understand opposing views.  
🔸 **Polarization & division** – When people only see what reinforces their beliefs, society becomes more divided.  
🔸 **Misinformation thrives** – Algorithms favor engagement over accuracy, often pushing sensational content over truth.  
🔸 **Critical thinking declines** – When everything you see confirms your biases, you stop questioning information.  

This isn’t just about social media. **It’s shaping politics, news, and even your daily decisions.** 
If you don’t break out, you risk becoming a **passive consumer** instead of an **active thinker**.  

So, how exactly does this work? Let’s break it down. ⬇️
