I spent hours trying to export an APK from a React Native Expo project—without ejecting it. 
It took me nearly half a day to figure out, so I’m writing this guide to save you the trouble.

Let’s dive straight into the commands you need

## Steps to Build an APK from Expo  

Alright, let's get straight to it. Follow these steps to build your APK without ejecting your Expo project.  

### 1. Install Dependencies  

First things first, make sure you have all the necessary packages installed:  

```bash
npm install  
npx expo install expo-dev-client  
```

### 2. Check for Issues (Optional)  

If you want to make sure your project is in good shape before building, run:  

```bash
npx expo-doctor  
```

This will scan your project and let you know if there are any issues that might cause trouble during the build.  

### 3. Fix Package Compatibility Issues (If Needed)  

If you run into any package version mismatches, you can fix them easily by running:  

```bash 
npx expo install --fix  
```

### 4. Build the Project  

Now, if everything looks good, it's time to build the project. Run:  

```bash
eas build --profile development --platform android  
```

Make sure you're logged into your Expo account before running this command. If you don’t have one, create it from the official [expo website](https://expo.dev/).  

By default, this will generate an `.aab` file instead of an `.apk` file. If you need an APK, there’s one more step.  

## Modifying `eas.json` to Get an APK  

To get an APK instead of an AAB, you’ll need to modify your `eas.json` file. Here’s what it should look like:  

```json
{  
  "build": {  
    "production": {
      "autoIncrement": true,
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      }
    }
  }  
}  
```

Once you've updated the `eas.json` file, run this command to generate the APK:  

eas build --profile production --platform android  

And that's it! Now you’ll have your APK file ready to install or share.  

## Wrapping Up  

And that's it! You now have a working APK from your Expo project—without having to eject. Whether you're testing your app or distributing it outside the Play Store, this method keeps your workflow smooth and hassle-free.
