Securing your website with HTTPS is no longer optional. Itâ€™s a fundamental requirement for trust, SEO, and modern web features. Luckily, Letâ€™s Encrypt makes it free, and Certbot makes it easy. In this post, weâ€™ll walk through installing an SSL certificate using Certbot on both Apache and Nginx servers.

Letâ€™s start by figuring out what server your system is running.

---

## Step 1: Check Your Web Server Type

Youâ€™ll need to know whether your server uses Apache or Nginx. Run this command:

**To check running web server:**

```bash
sudo ss -tulwn | grep -E '80|443'
```

**Or check installed packages:**

```bash
apache2 -v
```

If Apache is installed, you'll see version info. If not:

```bash
nginx -v
```

Still unsure? Try this:

```bash
ps aux | grep -E 'apache2|nginx'
```

Now that youâ€™ve figured it out, letâ€™s install SSL using Certbot.

## Step 2: Install Certbot

Certbot is a client that simplifies the process of obtaining and installing SSL certificates. Itâ€™s available for both Apache and Nginx.

Install Certbot and the plugin matching your web server.

**For Debian/Ubuntu:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache   # for Apache
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx    # for Nginx
```

**For CentOS/RHEL:**

```bash
sudo dnf install epel-release
sudo dnf install certbot python3-certbot-apache   # for Apache
sudo dnf install certbot python3-certbot-nginx    # for Nginx
```

---

## Step 3: Get SSL Certificate with Certbot

Now that Certbot is installed, you can use it to get an SSL certificate.

**For Apache:**

```bash
sudo certbot --apache
```

Certbot will automatically detect your virtual hosts and ask you which domains to enable HTTPS for. Follow the prompts.

---

**For Nginx:**

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx
```

Follow the prompts to complete the process. Certbot will ask you for your email address and agree to the terms of service.Same as Apache, Certbot will configure your server blocks automatically.

---

## Step 4: Auto-Renewal

Letâ€™s Encrypt certificates are valid for 90 days. Certbot sets up a systemd timer or cron job by default. You can test the renewal process:

```bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

If everything looks good, you can run the renewal process without the dry-run flag:

```bash
sudo certbot renew
```

## Done ðŸŽ‰

Whether you're on Apache or Nginx, your site should now be secured with a valid SSL certificate. Visit your domain with `https://` and verify the padlock.

If youâ€™re using a different web server (like Caddy or Lighttpd), or need to manually configure Certbot, you can explore more options at [Certbotâ€™s documentation](https://certbot.eff.org).
