So, I was facing this issue that says `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading useReducer)` with **Next.js project with the App Router** for quite a long time.

For a moment, I thought this problem is speicific to my device, and I will no longer be able to run nextjs projects.

I was true to a certain point, which is, the problem is indeed specific to my device, but not becuase I am using a MacBook with M chip. Here's what went wrong and how I fixed it.

## 🔍 **Identifying the Issues**

At some point, I had **globally installed Next.js** while working on a **Page Router-based project**, and it ran without any issues. However, when I switched to an **App Router-based project**, things started breaking and I was unable to run any nextjs projects.

What made it harder to find the issue is, running `next dev` or `npm run dev` **didn't throw any errors initially**
—the project seemed to start as expected. But when I opened it in the browser, I was greeted with:
`TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useReducer')`

At first, it was frustrating because every Google search led to generic solutions for the `useReducer` error.
But my issue went deeper—it was a conflict between the **globally installed Next.js** and the **locally installed version in the project**.

So, let’s break down the exact steps I took to diagnose and fix this.

## **⚠️ 1. Global Next.js Installation Not Working Properly**

For some reason, I thought to remove any `next` installed in my device by running:

```bash
npm uninstall -g next
```

After that I removed the project's `node_modules` folder along with the `package-lock.json` by running:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
```

## **🔎 2. Running Next.js After Cleanup → 'Command Not Found'**

After cleaning up the project, I tried to run `next dev` or `npm run dev` again. But I was greeted with an error:

```bash
> nextjs@0.1.0 dev
> next dev

sh: next: command not found
```

I even tried running `npx run dev` but that also resulted the same error.

## **🛠️ 3. Checking Next.js Installation Inside the Project**

First, I started by checking the version of `next` installed in the project by running:

```bash
npm list next
```

and I got the following output:

```bash
nextjs@0.1.0 /Users/username/project_path
└── next@13.5.1
```

Now that I know Next,js was installed locally, I checked if the binary file existed by running

```bash
ls -l node_modules/.bin/next
```

Which returned:

```bash
lrwxr-xr-x@ 1 username  staff  21 Mar  5 17:02 node_modules/.bin/next -> ../next/dist/bin/next
```

Which means, the **Next.js binary file** was present, but for some reason, it still wasn't running!

## **✅ 4. Manually Running Next.js Worked**

So, I decided to manually run the Next.js binary file by running:

```bash
node node_modules/next/dist/bin/next dev
```

This **successfully started the project!** Meaning the issue wasn’t with Next.js itself but with how my terminal was resolving it.

## **🔧 5. Fixing the Path Issue (Temporary & Permanent Solutions)**

### 🛠️ Temporary Fix

To immediately fix the issue for my current terminal session, I updated the path manually:

```bash
export PATH="./node_modules/.bin:$PATH"
```

After running this, `npm run dev` worked fine.

### 🔒 Making It Permanent

To ensure I wouldn’t need to run this command every time, I added it to my `.zshrc`:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="./node_modules/.bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, the issue was permanently resolved along with the issue that I was facing with the `useReducer` error.
