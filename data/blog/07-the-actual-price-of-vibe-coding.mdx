summary: 'Vibe coding feels productive, but at what cost? From increased procrastination to weakened critical thinking, here’s the hidden price you pay.'

Vibe coding—when you just _go with the flow_, coding based on _feelings_ rather than structured thought. It feels good. It feels productive. But what’s the real cost?

I've been vibe coding for a few weeks now, and here's what I think is the hidden cost.

## 1. Prone to Procrastination

Vibe coding often thrives on _motivation spikes_. You feel inspired, you write a lot of code, but when that _vibe_ fades? You struggle to get started again. Unlike structured problem-solving, which follows a logical progression, vibe coding makes you dependent on _mood_ rather than _discipline_.

Here's another way vibe coding cause you procrastinate:

1. You provided an instruction to do a certain changed to your code.
2. The AI is working on it.
3. You don't like to wait to see the result.
4. You jump to something else while the AI is still working.
5. You actually forgot about the project you were working on and you move to something else!

## 2. Loss of Critical Thinking

Instead of deeply understanding problems, you start _guessing_ and _tweaking_ until something works. Over time, this erodes your ability to break down complex issues. The habit of structured debugging and architectural planning weakens, making you less effective in long-term problem-solving.

## 3. Harder to Scale

When coding on vibes, you might not think about readability, maintainability, or how your code fits into a bigger system. This makes collaboration harder. When others read your code (or even _you_ in a few weeks), it’s often messy, inconsistent, and full of hacks.

## 4. Accidental Reinforcement of Bad Habits

When you code by intuition alone, you’re likely reinforcing _wrong assumptions_. You might cut corners without realizing it, normalize bad patterns, and end up with a skill set that’s more about _hacks_ than _engineering_.

## 5. Increased Mental Fatigue

Vibe coding gives short-term dopamine but leads to long-term burnout. Since you're not following a structured approach, every task feels like a _new challenge_, requiring fresh energy. The unpredictability of progress drains you faster than a steady, methodical workflow.

### So, What’s the Alternative?

This isn’t to say you should never _flow_ with your code. But mix it with structured approaches:

- **Plan before coding.** Even a simple outline helps.
- **Develop debugging discipline.** Don’t just tweak; analyze.
- **Force yourself to slow down.** Code in a way that your _future self_ will thank you for.

Vibe coding feels good in the moment, but without balance, it costs _more than you realize_.
