This is my personal blog where I document my journey through the ever-evolving world of technology and software development. I share insights, discoveries, and practical knowledge gained from my experiences as a backend developer, covering everything from technical tutorials to professional growth and industry observations.

As a backend developer with over 5 years of experience, I've had the privilege of building scalable solutions for 250+ clients worldwide, currently focusing on telemedicine infrastructure. Through this blog, I aim to contribute to the developer community by sharing not just technical insights, but also practical approaches to problem-solving and professional growth. When I'm not coding or writing, I channel my passion for web development into creating browser extensions that enhance developer productivity.
